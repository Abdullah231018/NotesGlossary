                        <h2>Transmission of data</h2>
                        <h3>Asynchronous data transmission</h3>
                        <p>It refers to data being trasnmitted in an agreed bit pattern. Data bits are grouped together & sent with control bits. This means the receiver of the data knows when the data starts and ends, prevents data getting mixed up</p>
                        <h3>Synchronous data transmission</h3>
                        <p>It is a continuous stream of data (not in discrete groups like asynchronous). Ensures that the sender and receiver are synchronised with each other. Hence, making it the faster method. </p>
                        <hr>

                        <h2>Serial & parallel transmission</h2>
                        <h3>Serial data transmission </h3>
                        <p> It's when data is sent one bit at a time over a single wire. It works well over long distances. Though, data is transmitted at a slower rate</p>

                        <h3>Parallel data transmission</h3>
                        <p>It's when data several bits (1 byte) are sent down several wires at the same time. It works well over a short distance and it is the faster method. </p>
                        <hr>

                        <h2>Simplex, half-duplex and full-duplex</h2>
                        <h3>Simplex data transmission</h3>
                        <p>Signal is transmitted in one direction only. <br>For example: Computer to printer.</p></p>

                        <h3>Half-duplex transmission</h3>
                        <p>Signal is transmitted in both direction but not at the same time. <br> For example: Phone conversations.</p>

                        <h3>Full-duplex data transmission</h3>
                        <p>Signal is transmitted in both directions simultaneously. <br> For example: Broadband connection.</p>
                        <hr>

                        <h2>Universal serial bus (USB)</h2>
                        <p>USB is an asynchronous serial data transmission method.</p>

                        <h2>Security aspects</h2>
                        <h3>Hacking</h3>
                        <p>It is the act of gaining illegal access to a computer system.<br> It can lead to identity theft and loss of personal information. To prevent hacking one can use Firewalls, strong passwords and use of anti-hacking software. 
                        </p>
                        <p>Hacking breaks into a computer system to steal data whereas cracking is where one edits a program code for malicious reasons.</p>

                        <h3>Viruses</h3>
                        <p>Program that can replicate itself with the intention of deleting or corrupting files, cause computer malfunction.<br> It can lead to a device to crashing and deletion or corruption of data. To prevent this one can install an authentic anti-virus software.</p>

                        <h3>Wardriving</h3>
                        <p>The act of locating and using wireless internet connections illegally.<br> An attacker can hack into wireless network and steal user's password and steal internet time. To prevent this one can use firewalls and strong password.</p>

                        <h3>Spyware</h3>
                        <p>It is a software that gathers info by monitoring key presses on the userâ€™s keyboard and info is sent back.<br> An attacker can have access to all data enter and read cookie data. To prevent it an anti-spyware software can be used.</p>
                        <hr>

                        <h2>Internet principles of operation</h2>
                        <h3>Internet protocol (IP) address</h3>
                        <p>Each device on the internet is given a unique address known as the IP address. 32-bit number written in the form: 109.108.158.1 . IP address gives the location of a device on the internet whereas the MAC address identifies the device connected to the internet. IP address changes but MAC address remains unchanged. </p>

                        <h3>HyperText Mark-up Language (HTML)</h3>
                        <p>It is used when writing and developing pages. Mark-up language is used in the processing. Html is used to bracket piece of codes. Different intensity of colours is determined by its hexadecimal value </p>

                        <h3>Media Acces Control (MAC)</h3>
                        <p>MAC address refers to a number which uniquely identifies a device on the internet. Refers to the network interface card (NIC) which is part of the device. Usually made up of 48 bits shown as six groups of hexadecimal digits. <br>NN:NN:NN:DD:DD:DD <br>(NN:NN:NN) first half is the identity number of the manufacturer of the device. <br>(DD:DD:DD) second half is the serial number of the device.</p>
                        <p><br>Types of MAC address:</p>
                        <dl>
                            <li>Universally Administrated MAC Address (UAA)</li>
                            <li>Locally Administrated MAC Address (LAA)</li>
                        </dl>
                        <p>UAA is the most common type set by the manufacturer.</p>

                        <h3>Web addresses</h3>
                        <p> Each character on the keyboard has its own ASCII code. It can be represented using hexadecimal or decimal values. Hexadecimal addresses are used in the address of files or webpages as a security figure. Takes longer to type in URL but advantage is that you are unlikely to fall into the trap of copying a fake website</p>

                        <h3>Cookies</h3>
                        <p>A packet of information sent by a web server to a web browser. Generated each time the user visits the website. Every time a user visits a website, cookies will have collected some key information about the user. They are able to carry out user tracking and maintain user preferences. Although cookies are pieces of data but does not gather personal information. </p>
